      <p>Whilst <em><strong>&ldquo;Bridges&rdquo;</strong></em> are built to span through obstacles, the preceding statement was quite erring in the city of <strong>Königsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia)</strong> during the <em><strong>18<sup>th</sup> century</strong></em>. Here we talk about the inception of <em><strong>Graph Theory</strong></em>, it&rsquo;s application to the real world problems and a famous puzzle asked during my childhood. The blog also contain a pretty good talk given by a math student below in <strong>Chaos Computer Club</strong> congression.</p>
<p>During the 18th century in the city of Königsberg the land masses were connected by seven bridges. The problem or challenge in the city was to walk or traverse through the seven bridges only once, i.e; to walk <em><strong>atmost</strong></em> only once on all the bridges. While the challenge was talk of the town during the period, we show on how <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> approached the problem that actually gave rise to <strong>&ldquo;Graph Theory&rdquo;</strong>.</p>

<p>The right most part of the image shows on how the land masses and bridges are converted into graph theoretic notation. The land masses are represented by a circle or commonly called <em><strong>&ldquo;Node or Vertex&rdquo;</strong></em> and the line connecting two nodes is called an <em><strong>&ldquo;Edge&rdquo;</strong></em>. An edge commonly defines a relationship between <em><strong>two</strong></em> nodes and they always <em><strong>connect two nodes</strong></em>. The last term to know is <em><strong>degree</strong></em> of a node which is actually the number of edges or lines incident on a node or vertex. Now since we got the basics of <strong>Graph Theory</strong> before diving into Euler&rsquo;s solution I would like share the childhood puzzle, well that&rsquo;s why the whole blog started out to be.</p>
<p>While in the <em><strong>90&rsquo;s and early 2000&rsquo;s</strong></em> my city <strong>Bangalore</strong> or more infamously known as <strong>Garden City or Land of 1000 lakes</strong> was absolutely a great city &amp; time to grow and have fun (name it from sport, education to being a cool kid you had it all). whoever you were one of the famous puzzle or  <strong>challenge</strong> thrown at us was <em><strong>to draw the below image without lifting your pen or pencil and most importantly you cannot pass over the line already drawn i.e; you cannot pass a line twice</strong></em>.</p>

<p>While the above can be <em><strong>converted</strong></em> into graph theoretical notation, just as how <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> did it. Well here is how, we can convert it by drawing circle or vertices or nodes at the four corners of the square and consider the line joining them as edges (curved lines are also edges). Now if you have tried solving the above you know that it is not possible to complete the following diagram, but almost possible well you may just miss one edge out of 10 (try). The explanation here is quite easy, I shall let you think with a hint <strong>&ldquo;degree of vertex&rdquo;</strong> well I hope that you paid attention to that term above to be more precise atleast two vertices or nodes or circles should have what number of degree&rsquo;s (odd or even)? <strong>Hmmm!! Well did that just reveal the answer, hope not!!</strong>. But hey, just so you did not get the above story that&rsquo;s absolutely fine see the video below to know more about Euler&rsquo;s solution to Königsberg problem:</p>

<p>I hope you got it now, oh well there is always something about <em><strong>old white men and being genius</strong></em> got to blame Einstein. [😛] For more entertainment and want to know more about graph theory and video games as <em><strong>&ldquo;we cool kids&rdquo;</strong></em> love playing PC games. Here is a video from <strong>Chaos Computer Club</strong></p>
<iframe width="768" height="576" src="https://media.ccc.de/v/SHA2017-319-mathematics_and_video_games/oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
The above video does have some very cool content if you are into ***topology***, just to put it across in simple terms imagine ***"when you get your wife so angry that she would squeeze a donut in her hand so hard that it turns into a sphere and these two are invariant",*** **hmmm!!!** must say now ***"that's not so pretty transformation huh??"*** Well if your a mathematician like me and your concerned with **"Topology"** I bet you would enjoy it as much as otherwise. [😄] <small> I'm not married yet, just so you know I could be in not so unique position say that.</small>
<p>The real world application of graph theory is quite immense due to its simplicity, it ranges from waking across the 18<sup>th</sup> century bridges to current navigation technology, yep that&rsquo;s right google maps does use it. You can also use it for scheduling airplanes, project management, production management and hey what&rsquo;s more important than scheduling your life ?</p>
<p><small>***Wanna know more feel free to comment or hit me up. I&rsquo;m always looking forward to help you and my philosophy to share knowledge, it&rsquo;s absolutely free, just get me coffee &amp; donut :P.***</small></p>
