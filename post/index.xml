      <description>This is pretty cool talk by Charles Stross, given at Chaos Computer Club congression this talk reflects my opinion or views on current world of corporates, startups, artificial intelligence (referred by speaker as corporate AI and computerized AI) and one ridiculed CEO or lets say more than one [:P]. You can also find reason&amp;rsquo;s on why I quit facebook or hated it in the first place.
The talk starts by saying on how prediction 3 centuries back or even a century back was possible to do accurately.</description>

      <description>Whilst &amp;ldquo;Bridges&amp;rdquo; are built to span through obstacles, the preceding statement was quite erring in the city of KÃ¶nigsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) during the 18th century. Here we talk about the inception of Graph Theory, it&amp;rsquo;s application to the real world problems and a famous puzzle asked during my childhood. The blog also contain a pretty good talk given by a math student below in Chaos Computer Club congression.</description>
